## Hello! Thanks for the opportunity

Please go to the frontend folder:

```bash
cd frontend
npm i 
npm run dev

```

Then to the backend folder
```bash
cd backend
npm i 
node index.js

```

You can use my OpenAI API key. I will change it later.
Please provide the input from DSA to get accurate results, since I am scrapping this from leetcode.
For now, this will generate only 5 questions because of the tokens limit
